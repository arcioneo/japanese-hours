This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What does it do?

This is just a simple react code that shows an [HTML page](https://japanese-hours.herokuapp.com/) that helps to study how to respond what time is it in japanese.

The clock component was taken(and slightly modified) from [zackargyle/react-analog-clock](https://github.com/zackargyle/react-analog-clock), 

Note: The only folder inside node_modules(react-analog-clock) was included on purpouse given it contains modifications of the original code but not good enough to create a pull request :)
